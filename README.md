PowerUp Flitchio Controller
===========================

**This is the official app to control the Tailor Toys PowerUp "paper airplane" with Flitchio**.

It is directly forked from their official app [TailorToys/app-powerup-android][powerup-repo],
which was itself forked from [TobyRich/app-smartplane-android][smartplane-repo].

We just add the Flitchio layer to it, allowing the plane to be piloted with Flitchio:
with physical buttons and joysticks, feel that you are now in control!
